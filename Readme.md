## Hash Encryption

Last year I had a research project on Hash Encryption in the module of Mathematics, modeling and operational research, So this repository contains **ppt** and **pdf** files (in french) which will help you to understand the cryptographic hash functions and if you already know stuff about this subject, it will still be useful because I will you a deeper understanding on hash encryption

- You will find also a Php file contains examples of predefined hash functions on php
- Javascript file of SHA-1 hash function implementation in JavaScript using POO (each instruction is accompanied by comments for explanation in English)
